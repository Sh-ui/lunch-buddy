## Lunch Buddy — Example Weeks (1–3)

These examples demonstrate how a focused weekly ingredient pool powers three categories:

- **Meal (Quick-Cook)**: brief cook, hot meal
- **Quick eat (Prepped & Ready)**: minimal assembly, cold or room temp
- **Grab and go**: true snackable/packable

Rules followed here:
- Example meals use only ingredients listed in that week’s grocery list. Pantry staples (salt, pepper, olive oil, vinegar, water) are always allowed.
- Every ingredient in a week’s list is used at least once across the examples.
- Proteins and core veggies show multiple uses where possible.
- Simple options (e.g., steamed veg with salt/pepper, basic clear soups) are encouraged and noted where helpful.
